#Automatic Google Analtics Even Tracking for WordPress#
Author: [Michael Schurpf](http://schurpf.com)

A very simple WordPress plugin to easily add Google Analytics automatically to certain files and links in WordPress.

Inspired by https://github.com/gregreindel/Add-Event-Tracking-To-Google-Alalytics-Via-jQuery

Other plugins like [Yoast's SEO Plugin](http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/) and others may also track similar files and links. It wont conflict, just be careful that some events may show up twice if you use both.

No options page at this point, you need to edit the js file.
